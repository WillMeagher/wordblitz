Word Blitz is a word game similar to the popular game wordle. Word Blitz allows users to play an unlimited number of games per day. Additionally, users can choose between a 3-minute timed blitz mode and a casual zen mode. Users can also select how many letters they would like in the word they are guessing. Users can choose anywhere between 3-and 6 letters. Word Blitz also includes a user profile where users can see a graph of all their previous games and a leaderboard where a user can compare their scores to others. 

Word Blitz was developed using node js with the express framework. The database is MongoDB and auth0 was used for handline user logins. The frontend files were constructed using jade views in combination with bootstrap. Word Blitz was hosted on an AWS ec2 instance and was reachable at wordblitz.org. It has since been taken down due to server costs.
